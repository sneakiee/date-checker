# Date Checker

## What does it do?

This program does simple math to find out what day of the week a certain date is!

## How to Use

Simply throw the code into a python interpreter and answer the questions in the console and a message will appear saying which day of the week it is.
**Note: This does not work with dates before 1753**

## Message from Dev

I made this project to teach myself how to use some of the basics of python.
Have fun!
